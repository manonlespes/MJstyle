# Project done within my training course
## Creation of a theme from scratch using Wordpress, Timber and Twig
### Music Teacher Website

For the last project within the trainign course, I wanted to use librairies and frameworks seen in courses but also the one also used by my futur company where I'll be doing an internship.

Initially, at Interface3, we didn't see Twig & Timber. 

This was a nice challenge and I wonder why we are still doing php when there is a wonder such as Twig :)

Check this out !
